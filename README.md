This repository demonstrates a rather uncommon HTML bug involving a missing semicolon in embedded JavaScript code. The bug is subtle and might not be immediately apparent to developers unfamiliar with the nuances of JavaScript syntax within an HTML context. The solution shows the correct way to use semicolons and avoid similar errors in the future.  The bug is primarily focused on the JavaScript and not the HTML structure itself.
